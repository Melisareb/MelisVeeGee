REMINDERS!

These Cutie Mark and Symbols vectors are made by me (Melisareb). 
You can download the SVG file for free.
Some of the reference of each vectors are hidden (layer 1) and made by other artists.
The display may be different or weird becuase of some problems of the SVG files.
The original characters (OCs) must be facing left or else, the cutie marks should flip horizontally if they are facing right (it depends to the owners of these OCs).
